## 📌 Project Purpose

SafeLearn is an **interactive workplace health and safety training system** designed specifically for warehouse operatives, picking technicians, and plant machinery operators in the automotive logistics sector. 

The system replaces passive static manuals with a gamified, scenario-driven digital learning ecosystem featuring:
- **Dual Role-Based Interfaces**:
  1. **Employee / Learner Experience**: Engaging, modern educational web application (not an administrative dashboard) with interactive hazard spotting, PPE checks, decision scenarios, and accredited digital certificates.
  2. **Admin / Supervisor Console**: Professional management dashboard for workforce tracking, question bank authoring, passing mark configuration, and compliance audit reporting.
- **UK Statutory Safety Compliance**: Grounded in the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974 (HASAWA), ISO 45001, and SEMA racking standards.
- **Verified 70% Pass Mark**: Knowledge assessments enforce a mandatory 70% threshold before issuing unique, verifiable completion certificates.
